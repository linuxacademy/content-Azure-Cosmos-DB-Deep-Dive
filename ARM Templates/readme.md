# ARM Templates

The templates in this directory represent the ones used as examples within the course videos and hands-on labs. They will evolve over time as bugs are fixed and improvements are found, so they may not look exactly as pictured within the videos.

**Templates:**
* GamingDatabase.json: This is a document database using the Core (SQL) API. It has the "Players" database and "Profiles" container.
* MetadataDatabase.json: This is a metadata database using the Table API. It has the "Sessions" table.
* ACGaming.json: This is a combination of the other two templates, pre-provisioning both the "Players" and metatdata databases.
