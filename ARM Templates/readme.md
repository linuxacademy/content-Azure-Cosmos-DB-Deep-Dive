# ARM Templates

The templates in this directory correlate to the ones used as examples within the course videos and hands-on labs. They will evolve over time as bugs are fixed and improvements are found, so they may not look exactly as pictured within the videos.

**Templates:**
* ACGaming.json: *Core (SQL) API*. This is the account for the "Players" database and "Profiles" container.
* ACGamingCharacters: *MongoDB API*. This is the account for the "Characters" database, where various builds can be specified.
* ACMetadata.json: *Azure Table API*. This is account for the "Sessions" metadata table.
* ACSCoring.json: *Cassandra API*. This is the account for the "leaderboard" keyspace and the "scores" table.
